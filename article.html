            <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Proper HTML coding ensures that web pages are accessible to users with disabilities or using assistive technologies. Semantic HTML elements improve screen reader compatibility and overall accessibility.</li>
            <li><strong>SEO:</strong> Search engines rely on HTML markup to understand and index web content. Well-structured HTML with relevant keywords and metadata can improve search engine rankings and visibility.</li>
            <li><strong>Cross-Browser Compatibility:</strong> HTML standards ensure that web pages render correctly across different browsers and devices. Consistent HTML coding practices reduce compatibility issues and enhance user experience.</li>
            <li><strong>Interactivity:</strong> HTML works in conjunction with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript to create interactive and dynamic web pages. HTML5 introduces new elements and features for multimedia, forms, and application development.</li>
        </ul>
